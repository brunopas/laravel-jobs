## Usage

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
<strong><a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node</a></strong>.<br>
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like <strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHP Storm</a></strong>.

### Installation
First, clone this repository, install the dependencies, and setup your <code>.env</code> file.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/brunopas/laravel-jobs.git
$ cd laravel-jobs

$ composer install
$ cp .env.example .env
```
This app uses <strong><a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a></strong>. To use something different, open up <code>config/Database.php</code> and change the default driver.<br>
To use MySQL, make sure you install it, setup a database and then add your DB credentials (database, username and password) to the <code>.env</code> file.

### Database Setup
Then, create the necessary database.
```bash
$ php artisan db
$ create database laravel_jobs
```

### Migrations
Finally, run the initial migrations and seeders.
```bash
$ php artisan migrate --seed
```

### File Uploading
When uploading files, they go to "storage/app/public". Create a symlink with the following command to make them publicly accessible.
```bash
$ php artisan storage:link
```

### Running
To serve the application on the PHP development server, run the following command:
```bash
$ php artisan serve
```
